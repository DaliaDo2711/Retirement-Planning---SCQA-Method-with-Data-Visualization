# Retirement-Planning_SCQA-Method-with-Data-Visualization

## Retirement Planning Under High Inflation

This project demonstrates how to apply the **SCQA (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer)** communication framework to a real-world **retirement planning scenario** using Python-based data simulations and visualizations.

The notebook combines **financial modeling**, **scenario analysis**, and **data storytelling** to show how structured communication can make complex analytical insights more accessible and actionable for decision-makers.

## Project Overview

Retirement planning is often built on long-term assumptions about market returns, inflation, and spending. This project explores what happens when those assumptions break, specifically under **high inflation and rising healthcare costs**, and how strategic portfolio adjustments can mitigate risk.

Using the SCQA framework, the analysis walks through:

- Establishing a baseline retirement plan
- Introducing real-world disruptions
- Framing the core decision question
- Delivering a data-backed optimization strategy

---

## SCQA Framework Structure

### 1. Situation  
**What the audience already accepts as true**

- Client accumulated **$1.2M** over 30 years
- Assumptions:
  - 7% annual market return
  - 4% withdrawal rate
  - 30-year retirement horizon
- Visualization:
  - Historical savings growth line chart
  - Expected retirement balance projection

---

### 2. Complication  
**What disrupts the original plan**

- Healthcare costs rise to **$30,000 per year**
- Costs begin in **Year 10 of retirement (age 75–85)**
- Inflation scenarios analyzed:
  - Normal inflation (2.5%)
  - High inflation (6.8%)

Visualizations include:
- Comparative area charts
- Fund depletion markers
- Inflation-driven gap annotations

Result:  
Under high inflation and rising healthcare costs, retirement funds deplete **earlier than planned**.

---

### 3. Question  
**What decision must be made**

> Can the portfolio sustain increased healthcare costs without depleting early, and what strategies can mitigate this risk?

This is framed using a **decision-tree network visualization**, illustrating:
- Strategic options
- Trade-offs between risk and lifestyle
- Potential outcomes

---

### 4. Answer  
**A data-supported optimization strategy**

An optimized retirement strategy is proposed and simulated with the following changes:

- Withdrawal rate reduced from **4.0% → 3.5%**
- Expected return increased from **7.0% → 7.3%**
- **45%** allocation to inflation-protected assets
- Improved diversification across asset classes

Visual outputs:
- Original vs optimized retirement balance comparison
- Portfolio allocation pie chart
- Key metrics dashboard

Result:  
The optimized strategy significantly **extends portfolio longevity**, even under high inflation and elevated healthcare costs.

## Visualizations Included

- Line charts for savings growth and retirement balances

---

## Key Takeaways

- SCQA provides a clear structure for data-driven storytelling
- Financial simulations are more persuasive when paired with narrative logic
- Visualization choice directly impacts decision clarity
- Small strategy adjustments can materially improve long-term outcomes

---

## Intended Audience

- Data Analysts and Data Scientists
